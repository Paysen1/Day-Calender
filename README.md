This challenge as very straight forward for me. using Dayjs is acctually very fun and a lot easier than writingout a long function for time. I also find it much easier/time saving to just call Jquery with $ and have the easier functionality. ran into some roadblocks but mostly just silly mistakes. Will defininatly be using any API at my disposal in the future!
